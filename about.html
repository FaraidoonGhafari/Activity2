            I'm a senior computer science student at University. I have a deep passion for coding,
            and my favorite programming language is Python. In addition to Python, I am good in several
            other languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, Java, C, and C++.

            I have learned HTML and CSS through tutorials and watching YouTube videos. I am constantly
            seeking to improve my skills and stay updated with the latest trends in technology.
            Whether itâ€™s through online courses, coding challenges, or collaborative projects,
            I am always eager to learn and grow as a developer.
